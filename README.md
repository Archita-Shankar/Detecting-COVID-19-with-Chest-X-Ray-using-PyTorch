## Project Description
In this project, **PyTorch** is used to create and train a **ResNet-18** model and apply it to a set of chest X-ray data. This dataset contains nearly **3,000 Chest X-Ray scans** categorized into three classes:  
- **Normal**,  
- **Viral Pneumonia**, and  
- **COVID-19**.  

The objective of this project is to develop an **image classification model** that can predict the class of a Chest X-Ray scan with a **reasonably high accuracy**.
